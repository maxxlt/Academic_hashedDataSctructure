 This is an academic project covering Hased Data Structure
## Obejectives:
* Know how to read the information of the object from an input file, place to the data structure
* Know how to store the informationof all nodes in data structure back to the text file before terminating the
program

of the LQhashed structure
* Recognize the LQHashed data structure is encapsulated
* Know how to display all the nodes in the LQHashed data structure on the screen
* Review the concept of Hashtable data structures
* Know how to implement the Java Hashtable class: use functions, put, get, remove, etc.
